        The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources Hunter Education
        Program is dedicated to the safe enjoyment of our outdoors. Through this
        program, students learn about responsibility and ethics in the field, as
        well as firearms safety.
      </p>
      <h2>Who needs a Hunter Education Card?</h2>
      <p>
        All residents and nonresidents born after June 30, 1979, must complete a
        hunter education course before a hunting license can be obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        SCDNR accepts hunter education certifications issued by other states in
        the United States and Canadian provinces. If you have a certification
        from another state, your certification meets the hunter education
        requirement in SC. If you have a question about your certification,
        please contact the Hunter Education Office at 1-800-277-4301.

      <h2>Which Hunter Education Course is right for you?</h2>
      <p>SCDNR offers two (2) options to take the Hunter Education Course.</p>

      <h3>1. Instructor-led Classes</h3>

      <p>
        The preferred Hunter Education method is through a
        <strong>free</strong> eight (8) hour instructor-led classroom course.
        Classes maybe offered in a one day class or split over two nights. All
        classes end with a <strong>Test</strong> to pass the course. <br />

      </p>
      <p>
        The South Carolina Hunter Education Class is recommended for motivated
        students 12 years of age and older with good reading and comprehension
        skills who have some firearm and hunting knowledge or experience. Course
        materials are on a 6th-grade reading level. While we do not discourage
        any age from attending the class, only children age 10 and older may
        take the final exam.
